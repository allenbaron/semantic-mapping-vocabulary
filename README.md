# SEMAPV: A Vocabulary for Semantic Mappings

The Semantic Mapping Vocabulary (SEMAPV) is a vocabulary about the processes, entities and agents involved in the curation of mappings. It is being developed in conjunction with the [Simple Standard for Sharing Ontology Mappings (SSSOM)](https://mapping-commons.github.io/sssom/spec/), providing a detailed vocabulary to describe, for example, different kinds of matching processes (lexical, logical, etc), as well as pre- and post-processing techniques employed.

**SEMAPV is currently in pre-Alpha state and is guaranteed to change, do not use in production.**
