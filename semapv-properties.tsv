skos:semanticRelation	semantic relation	A link between two concepts.	https://www.w3.org/TR/skos-reference/				
skos:mappingRelation	mapping relation	A mapping (alignment) link between two concepts.	https://www.w3.org/TR/skos-reference/				skos:semanticRelation
skos:closeMatch	close match	A match where the subject and object are sufficiently similar that they can be used interchangeably in some information retrieval applications.	https://www.w3.org/TR/skos-reference/				skos:mappingRelation
skos:exactMatch	exact match	A match where the subject and object are sufficiently similar, with a high degree of confidence, that they can be used interchangeably across a wide range of information retrieval applications.	https://www.w3.org/TR/skos-reference/				skos:closeMatch|semapv:isomorphicMatch
skos:broadMatch	broad match	A match where the object is a broader concept than the subject.	https://www.w3.org/TR/skos-reference/				semapv:nonIsomorphicMatch
skos:narrowMatch	narrow match	A match where the object is a narrower concept that the subject.	https://www.w3.org/TR/skos-reference/				semapv:nonIsomorphicMatch
skos:relatedMatch	related match	A match where the subject and the object are inherently related, but where none is in any way more general than the other.	https://www.w3.org/TR/skos-reference/				semapv:nonIsomorphicMatch
semapv:isomorphicMatch	isomorphic match	A match where the subject is isomorphic to the object, i.e. considered of identical or similar form, shape, or structure.	https://github.com/mapping-commons/semantic-mapping-vocabulary/issues/3				skos:mappingRelation
semapv:nonIsomorphicMatch	non-isomorphic match	A match where the subject cannot be considered isomorphic to the object, i.e. considered of identical or similar form, shape, or structure. The object corresponds to exactly one subject in the subject_source.	https://github.com/mapping-commons/semantic-mapping-vocabulary/issues/3				skos:mappingRelation
semapv:crossSpeciesExactMatch	cross-species exact match	A match where the subject is considered analogous to the object in a different taxonomic grouping.	https://github.com/mapping-commons/semantic-mapping-vocabulary/issues/3	FBbt:00005074 (D. melanogaster “muscle cell”) and CL:0000187 (taxon-neutral “muscle cell”) are a cross-species exact match.			semapv:isomorphicMatch|skos:relatedMatch
semapv:crossSpeciesBroadMatch	cross-species broad match	A match where the subject is considered analogous to the subject in a different taxonomic grouping, but the object refers to a broader concept.	https://github.com/mapping-commons/semantic-mapping-vocabulary/issues/3	FBbt:00007091 (D. melanogaster “subperineurial glial sheath”) and UBERON:0000202 (taxon-neutral “glial blood brain barrier”) are a cross-species broad match.			skos:broadMatch
semapv:crossSpeciesNarrowMatch	cross-species narrow match	A match where the subject is considered analogous to the subject in a different taxonomic grouping, but the object refers to a narrower concept.	https://github.com/mapping-commons/semantic-mapping-vocabulary/issues/3				skos:narrowMatch
